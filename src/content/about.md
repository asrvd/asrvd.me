# About Me
#### Most of the things you (maybe) want to know about me

I'm ashish aka asheeshh on the web. I'm a 19 y/o student belonging to the Homo Sapiens species, a brother, a son, a friend, a self taught web developer and programmer, an open source enthusiasist, an extreme melophile and I go by the bio - [best of the worst sides](https://genius.com/12990359/Eden-drugs/Cause-i-had-the-best-of-the-worst-sides).

As my age already suggests, I'm a high school graduate and an undergrad in college pursuing B.Tech (soon). I had already started programming back when I was in 11th standard as we had python in our school curriculum. I started web development one year later and I like working on the web a lot (mostly frontend). Oh, btw - I don't design my web apps 😱. If you want to know about what programming languages I know, they are - typescript, python, go and a little bit of ruby and cplusplus.

I'm also into technical writing and blogging. I write mostly on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/asheeshh). I'm also a freelace technical writer for [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) and [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com).

Things I do other than dev and programming? Not much, but I do play football (touching grass is important). I also just like to go on the terrace with soft music and watch clouds pass by 😳. I've also started gaming recently (only [VALORANT](https://playvalorant.com)). Apart from these, I don't have much to do other than overthinking and staring at my phone screen.

I don't talk much over any platform but I like making friends (be it online or irl though I'm somewhat introverted!). So, in case you want to talk about anything, just hit me up and I'll get back to you once I'm active/online. All my social links are listed [here](/links).

That's pretty much everything I know about me yet. In case you know something about me that I still don't, please let me know - I'll add it here.
