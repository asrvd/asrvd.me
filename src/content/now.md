#Now
#### The answer to "What are you upto these days?"

*Sigh*, the year is about to end in like 3 days, feels like I was writing the last content for my `/now` page the last week only. 2022 has been a **not-so-good-but-not-so-bad** year for me. There were things I couldn't accomplish but there were also a large number of things I did accomplish. In fact I was able to check out most of the stuff from my 2022 checklist and that's a huge accomplishment according to me.

I did make a lot of memories worth remembering this year, made new friends, lost some friends but in the end none of it really matters except the fact that I survived yet another year. So, in case you want to know what I have been doing, I have been wasting a good amount of time playing Valorant and apart from that I tried exploring [Svelte Kit](https://github.com/asrvd/sveltekit-guestbook), I haven't been coding consistently tbh but I did try Advent of Code and sadly I lost on day 14 :(

These last 3 days of 2022, I'm going to spend most of it doing productive things *hopefully* and spend some time with family since college is closed for holidays. This is it for this time ig, see ya next year -- and wishing you a very happy new year in advance in case you read it before it and a very happy belated new year in case you read it after it. Bye.
